### BUGS ###
- on mobile prod, the resign modal is still not shown for the resigning player
  need to fix the close logic for the modal

### FEATURES ###
- currently, on the client the complete game state is replaced by a new one which
  causes the game to flicker on safari for example, but it is also bad performance
  and is connected to the delay issue below. we should only send the diff,
  resp. the mode that is being made.
  alternatively, we can calculate the diff on the client-side.
- prevent delay of movement (caused by client-server communication), maybe
  make the move also on the client-side, send it to the server and to the other
  clients, and send it back to the original to verify its integrity and only
  if not update it.


### DESIGN ####
- drag and drop on desktop to move pieces, since clicking is not intuitive,
  that should also work on mobile if possible


### STRUCTURE ###
- move class to validate promotion for example
- try to reduce god class "Game" to simpler modules
- increase Jest test coverage
- more defensive programming
- technical documentation about project structure and dependencies in readme
