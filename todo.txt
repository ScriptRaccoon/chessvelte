### BUGS ###
- check if app works on safari


### FEATURES ###
- save gamestates in redis to prevent data loss
  e.g. during deployment
- to prepare for this, write Game.to_json and Game.from_json methods
- prevent delay of movement (caused by client-server communication)
  -> maybe make the move also on the client-side and only double check
     on the server-side
- drag and drop on desktop to move pieces


### DESIGN ####
- animation of pieces (WIP)
- captured pieces card is too prominent
- captures pieces are not centered vertically


### STRUCTURE ###
- after removing use:enhance to fix the clearing bug, the URLs are not so nice anymore:
  - game/9G99LG?/start for example. try to find a different solution.
- game.status should not be 'promotion', promotion should be event-based
- try to reduce god class "Game" to simpler modules
- increase Jest test coverage
- more defensive programming
- technical documentation about project structure and dependencies in readme
