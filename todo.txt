### BUGS ###
- when joining a game, the invitation modal is shown for a short time
- when game has ended, the current player will still click on the board
  and get the outcome modal again

### FEATURES ###
- offer draw feature
- check turn-allowance also on server
- save gamestates in redis to prevent data loss
  e.g. during deployment
- error messages for clients when game does not exist
- confirm to resign

### DESIGN ####
- find good usage of player name, and if none exists just drop it
- prevent layout shift when first piece is captured

### STRUCTURE ###
- reduce god class "game" to simpler modules
- move class maybe
- find_by_player is not good since it iterates through all games
- style:--w={w}

### DEPLOYMENT ###
- deploy sveltekit app on netlify
- deploy socket server separately, for example on fly.io
