### BUGS ###


### FEATURES ###
- currently, the complete game state is replaced by a new one which causes
  the game to flicker on safari for example, but it is also bad performance
  and is connected to the delay issue below. we should only send the diff,
  resp. the mode that is being made.
- prevent delay of movement (caused by client-server communication), maybe
  make the move also on the client-side, send it to the server and to the other
  clients, and send it back to the original to verify its integrity and only
  if not update it.

- when everything else is implemented: save gamestates in redis to prevent data loss
  e.g. during deployment. to prepare for this, write Game.to_json and Game.from_json methods


### DESIGN ####
- drag and drop on desktop to move pieces, since clicking is not intuitive
- animation of pieces (for some reason, adding css transition does not work,
  even when we add the IDs to the pieces and use a keyed-each-block)
- captured pieces card is too prominent
- captures pieces are not centered vertically


### STRUCTURE ###
- move class to validate promotion for example
- try to reduce god class "Game" to simpler modules
- increase Jest test coverage
- more defensive programming
- technical documentation about project structure and dependencies in readme
