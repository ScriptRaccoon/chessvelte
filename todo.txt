### BUGS ###
- fix keyboard nav
- check if app works on safari
- when user tries to join non-existing game, their name is cleared from the form
- similarly, when non-authenticated user joins game by id and doesn't fill the name,
  the game ID is cleared from the form


### FEATURES ###
- send game winner to chat
- save gamestates in redis to prevent data loss
  e.g. during deployment
- to prepare for this, write Game.to_json and Game.from_json methods
- status messages are posted to the chat window
- different board designs to select
- (maybe) profile page, avatar, auth
- prevent delay of movement (caused by client-server communication)
  -> maybe make the move also on the client-side and only double check
     on the server-side

### DESIGN ####
- rotation of board moves it slightly, need to find coord solution
- animation of pieces (WIP)
- show previously made move (to both players)
- move captures to the aside on desktop view
- improve design of captures section, maybe card with heading

### STRUCTURE ###
- reduce god class "Game" to simpler modules
- write more Jest Tests
	- also for config.ts
	- get_save_moves in Piece class
- more defensive programming
- technical documentation about project structure and dependencies in readme
