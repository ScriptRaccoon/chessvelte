### BUGS ###
- when player comes back to the game and the game is ended,
  the outcome will be cleared

### FEATURES ###
- save gamestates in redis to prevent data loss
  e.g. during deployment
- error messages for clients when game does not exist
- do not send other socket_id to clients since that is not secure
- personalize outcome message
- more defensive programming
- navigating to a different page should disconnect

### DESIGN ####
- find good usage of player name, and if none exists just drop it
- prevent layout shift when first piece is captured
- show in navbar or somewhere "A vs. B" with A,B = names of the players
- make smaller title, move maybe to nav, on /game/xyz

### STRUCTURE ###
- reduce god class "game" to simpler modules
- move class maybe
- player class maybe
- write more Jest Tests

### DEPLOYMENT ###
- deploy sveltekit app on netlify (DONE)
- deploy socket server separately, for example on fly.io
- run jest tests for every git push
