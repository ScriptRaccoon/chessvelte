### BUGS ###

### FEATURES ###
- connected chess components to backend logic
- what we need for emitted gamestate from server to client:
   - selected coordinate (currently called move_start_coord: rename this)
   - possible targets (of selected piece)
   - a dictionary coord -> piece | null where pieces only need
     type, color, not all the rest from the backend
   - the game.status   
   - game.promotion_move (but maybe ignore promotion first)
- everything else, that currently depends on the game state,
  can actually be made independent from it -> remove feature envyness
- emitted events from client to backend:
  - square is clicked / selected
  - promotion piece type is chosen
  - promotion is cancelled
  - restart

### DESIGN ####

### STRUCTURE ###
- production version of socket.io server
- backend code should be separate from frontend code,
  in particular no import dependencies
- overwriting the current game state with the one from the backend
  should remove the move_counter and game.rerender hacks
