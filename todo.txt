### DESIGN ####

### STRUCTURE ###
- prevent the need for .js imports in server app
- setup path alias in server app for shared folder
- fix dev environment for server app
- reduce god class "game" to simpler modules
- move class maybe
- find_by_player is not good since it iterates through all games


### DEPLOYMENT ###
- deploy sveltekit app on netlify
- deploy socket server separately, for example on fly.io
