### BUGS ###
- 

### FEATURES ###
- bring back promotion feature
- offer draw feature
- check turn-allowance also on server
- save gamestates in redis to prevent data loss
  e.g. during deployment
- error messages for clients when game does not exist

### DESIGN ####
- find usage of player name, and if none exists just drop it
- overlay of dialog is too small when scrollbars are present

### STRUCTURE ###
- reduce god class "game" to simpler modules
- move class maybe
- find_by_player is not good since it iterates through all games
