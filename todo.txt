### BUGS ###
- fix keyboard nav
- check if app works on safari

### FEATURES ###
- save gamestates in redis to prevent data loss
  e.g. during deployment
- to prepare for this, write Game.to_json and Game.from_json methods
- when being redirected to ?/id=xyz because name or client id was missing,
  an appropriate message should be shown that it has to be filled,
  and only the join-option should be visible, so that users don't join a random game
- chat window where status messages are posted and the players can talk
- different board designs to select
- (maybe) profile page, avatar, auth
- prevent delay of movement (caused by client-server communication)
  -> maybe make the move also on the client-side and only double check
     on the server-side

### DESIGN ####
- animation of pieces (WIP)
- show previously made move (to both players)

### STRUCTURE ###
- reduce god class "Game" to simpler modules
- write more Jest Tests
	- also for config.ts
	- get_save_moves in Piece class
- more defensive programming
- technical documentation about project structure and dependencies in readme
