### BUGS ###


### FEATURES ###
- currently, the complete game state is replaced by a new one which causes
  the game to flicker on safari for example, but it is also bad performance
  and is connected to the delay issue below. we should only send the diff.
- prevent delay of movement (caused by client-server communication), maybe
  make the move also on the client-side and only double check on the server-side

- save gamestates in redis to prevent data loss
  e.g. during deployment
- to prepare for this, write Game.to_json and Game.from_json methods


### DESIGN ####
- drag and drop on desktop to move pieces, since clicking is not intuitive
- animation of pieces (for some reason, adding css transition does not work,
  even when we add the IDs to the pieces and use a keyed-each-block)
- captured pieces card is too prominent
- captures pieces are not centered vertically


### STRUCTURE ###
- after removing use:enhance to fix the clearing bug, the URLs are not so nice anymore:
  - game/9G99LG?/start for example. try to find a different solution.
- game.status should not be 'promotion', promotion should be event-based
- try to reduce god class "Game" to simpler modules
- increase Jest test coverage
- more defensive programming
- technical documentation about project structure and dependencies in readme
